# Python - Sets

## What is Set?

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l3-A0O42Lyo/maxresdefault.jpg)


In Python, A set is a mutable collection of distinct hashable objects, same as the list and tuple. Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Each element in the set must be unique, immutable, and the sets remove the duplicate elements. Sets are mutable which means we can modify it after its creation.



A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.Unlike other collections in Python, there is no index attached to the elements of the set, i.e., we cannot directly access any element of the set by the index.

## Where we can use set?

* We can use set when unique values needed, Since sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element.
* It makes sets highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a list or tuple.
* We can use set, when we need to perform common math operations like unions and intersections.

## How to create set?

It can be created by built-in function : set ( ) or by curly braces : { }

```python
model_1 = set() # empyty set
```

```python
model_2 = {1,2,3,4,5} # set of numbers
```

```python
model_3 = {1,'dev',3,4,5} # set of different data types
```

```python
model_4 = {"a","b","c","d","e"} # same as set(["a","b","c","d","e"])
```

```python
myset = {(10,10), 10, 20} # This is also a valid set
```

```python
# Not possible
# since here list is mutable
# this will cause error

my_set = {1, 2, [3, 4]}   # Invalid set-declare
```
---

## Sample Program

#### Code - 1
```python
Days = {"Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"}    
print(Days)    # output will be unordered
print(type(Days))   
```
#### Output
```text
{'Friday', 'Tuesday', 'Monday', 'Saturday', 'Thursday', 'Sunday', 'Wednesday'}
<class 'set'>
```

#### Code - 2
```python
set_a = {1,2,2,3,4,4,4,5,6,7,6,8}
print(set_a) # return with only unique values
```

#### Output
```text
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
```

---

## Converting to Set
```python
set1 = set("Devincept") # convert string to set
set2 = set((1,2,3,4,5)) # convert tuple to set
day = {1:'Monday', 2:'Tuesday'}
set3 = set(day) # convert dictionary to set
```

---

## Set as Constructor

It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set.

```python
set_1 = set(("volvo", "bwm", "tata")) # note the double round-brackets
print(set_1)
```

---

## Access Elements in a Set

You cannot simply access the elements by indexing, beacuse it is unordered set.

But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.


Lets look into above exapmle

```python
set_1 = {"volvo", "bwm", "tata"}
for i in set_1:
    print(i)
```

To check the elements present in the set

```python
set_1 = {"volvo", "bwm", "tata"}
print("bwm" in set_1) # True
print("Tata" in set_1) # False since python is case-sensitive.
```
---

## Methods in Set

Set has some built-in function that can be used. Here we can see each method detailed through example

1. __add()__

    The add() method adds an element to the set.
    If the element already exists, the add() method does not add the element.

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    vegetable.add('potato')
    print(vegetable)
    ```

1. **clear()**

    The clear() method removes all elements in a set.

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    vegetable.clear()
    print(vegetable)
    ```

1. **copy()**

    The copy() method copies the set.

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = vegetable.copy()
    print(veg)
    ```


1. **difference()**

    The difference() method returns a set that contains the difference between two sets.The returned set contains items that exist only in the first set, and not in both sets.

    ![Difference](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/set-difference.jpg)

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = {'potato', 'pears', 'carrot'}

    v = vegetable.difference(veg)
    print(v)
    ```

1. **difference_update()**

    The difference_update() method removes the items that exist in both sets.

    The difference_update() method is different from the difference() method, because the difference() method returns a new set, without the unwanted items, and the difference_update() method removes the unwanted items from the original set.

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = {'potato', 'pears', 'carrot'}

    vegetable.difference_update(veg)
    print(vegetable)
    ```


1. **discard()**

    The discard() method removes the specified item from the set.

    This method is different from the remove() method, because the remove() method will raise an error if the specified item does not exist, and the discard() method will not.

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    vegetable.discard('onion')
    print(vegetable)
    ```

1. **intersection()**

    The intersection() method returns a set that contains the similarity between two or more sets.

    The returned set contains only items that exist in both sets, or in all sets if the comparison is done with more than two sets.

    ![Intersect](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Venn0001.svg/1200px-Venn0001.svg.png)

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = {'potato', 'pears', 'carrot'}

    v = vegetable.intersection(veg)
    print(v)
    ```

1. **intersection_update()**

    The intersection_update() method removes the items that is not present in both sets (or in all sets if the comparison is done between more than two sets).

    The intersection_update() method is different from the intersection() method, because the intersection() method returns a new set, without the unwanted items, and the intersection_update() method removes the unwanted items from the original set.

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = {'potato', 'pears', 'carrot'}

    vegetable.intersection_update(veg)
    print(vegetable)
    ```

1. **isdisjoint()**

    The isdisjoint() method returns True if none of the items are present in both sets, otherwise it returns False.

    ![Disjoint](https://codedestine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PythonSetOpDisjoint.png)

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = {'potato', 'pears', 'carrot'}

    v = vegetable.isdisjoint(veg)
    print(v)
    ```

1. **issubset()**

    The issubset() method returns True if all items in the set exists in the specified set, otherwise it retuns False.

    ![Subset](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Venn_A_subset_B.svg/1200px-Venn_A_subset_B.svg.png)

    ```python
    x = {"a", "b", "c"}
    y = {"f", "e", "d", "c", "b", "a"}

    z = x.issubset(y)
    print(z)
    ```
1. **issupperset()**

    The issuperset() method returns True if all items in the specified set exists in the original set, otherwise it retuns False.

    ![Superset](https://codedestine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PythonSetOpSuperSet1.png)

    ```python
    x = {"a", "b", "c"}
    y = {"f", "e", "d", "c", "b", "a"}

    z = x.issuperset(y)
    print(z)
    ```

1. **pop()**

    The pop() method removes a random item from the set.

    This method returns the removed item.

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    vegetable.pop('onion')
    print(vegetable)
    ```

1. **remove()**

    The remove() method removes the specified element from the set.

    This method is different from the discard() method, because the remove() method will raise an error if the specified item does not exist, and the discard() method will not.

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    vegetable.remove('onion')
    print(vegetable)
    ```

1. **union()**

    The union() method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified set(s).

    You can specify as many sets you want, separated by commas.

    ![Union](https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/n..png)

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = {'potato', 'pears', 'carrot'}

    v = vegetable.union(veg)
    print(v)
    ```


1. **update()**

    The update() method updates the current set, by adding items from another set (or any other iterable).

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = {'potato', 'pears', 'carrot'}

    vegetable.update(veg)
    print(vegetable)
    ```

1. **symmetric_difference()**

    The symmetric_difference() method returns a set that contains all items from both set, but not the items that are present in both sets.

    ![Symmetric_difference](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/symmetric-difference.jpg)

     ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = {'potato', 'pears', 'carrot'}

    v = vegetable.symmetric_difference(veg)
    print(v)
    ```

1. **symmetric_difference_update()**

    The symmetric_difference_update() method updates the original set by removing items that are present in both sets, and inserting the other items.

    ```python
    vegetable = {'carrot','onion','beans'}
    veg = {'potato', 'pears', 'carrot'}

    vegetable.symmetric_difference(veg)
    print(vegetalbe)
    ```

## Operators in Set


The set not only work with built-in commands but also it works with operators.

1.  **in**

    To check elements present in the set

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    print(2 in set1)
    ```

1.  **not in**

    To check elements not present in the set

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    print(2 not in set1)
    ```

1.  **==**

    To check elements present in both the sets are equal 

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    set2 = {1,2,4,5,6}
    print(set1 == set2)
    ```

1.  **!=**

    To check elements present in both the sets are not equal

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    set2 = {1,2,4,5,6}
    print(set1 != set2)
    ```

1.  **<=**

    To check elements of the sets1 are less than or equal to set 2.

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    set2 = {1,2,4,5,6}
    print(set1 <= set2)
    ```

1.  **>**
 
    To check elements of the sets1 are greater than set 2.

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    set2 = {1,2,4,5,6}
    print(set1 > set2)
    ```

1.  **|**

    To get union from two sets.

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    set2 = {1,2,4,5,6}
    set3 = set1 | set2
    print(set3)
    ```

1.  **&**

    To get intersection from two sets

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    set2 = {1,2,4,5,6}
    set3 = set1 & set2
    print(set3)
    ```

1.  **^**

    The set of elements in precisely one of s1 or s2

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    set2 = {1,2,4,5,6}
    set3 = set1 ^ set2
    print(set3)
    ```

1.  **-**

    Difference between set1 and set2

    ```python
    set1 = {1,2,3,4,5}
    set2 = {1,2,4,5,6}
    set3 = set1 - set2
    print(set3)
    ```

## Additional Concept


Let's Look into something interesting and it is part of set. Let's talk about Frozen set.

Frozen sets in Python are immutable objects that only support methods and operators that produce a result without affecting the frozen set or sets to which they are applied. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation.

If no parameters are passed, it returns an empty frozenset.

```python
normal_set = set(["a", "b","c"])
print(normal_set)

frozen_set = frozenset(["e", "f", "g"])
print(frozen_set)
```
